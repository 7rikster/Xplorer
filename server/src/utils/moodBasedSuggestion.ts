Requirements:
- Use the mood provided below.
- Recommend *only one* destination that best fits the mood.
- Output a *JSON* object with the following structure:
  - place: Name of the destination
  - country: Country of the destination
  - description: A short paragraph explaining why this destination fits the user's mood, including its vibe, activities, and atmosphere.

Mood: ${mood}

Respond in **clean, valid JSON only** (no markdown or comments), following the format below:
    { 
        "place": "Queenstown",
        "country": "New Zealand",
        "description": "Queenstown is known as the adventure capital of the world. It's perfect for an adventurous mood with thrilling activities like bungee jumping, skydiving, white-water rafting, and mountain biking. The stunning landscapes of mountains and lakes add to the adrenaline-fueled experience, making it a top pick for thrill-seekers."

Guidelines: Do not include markdown or extra text â€” **output only pure JSON**.
